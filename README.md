# Multimorbidity_Predictor
This repository contains python Implementations for a set of ML models that work together to predict co-occurring diseases in patients.
Although it uses multiple models, from a user point of view, it all acts as a single model.

Required Libraries: Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras

The data used is from the MIMIC-IV database. This will need to be downloaded after becoming a credentialed user and completing the required training. This data unfortunately cannot be provided here due to the same reasons.

The use of a device with access to a GPU is Highly recommended.
